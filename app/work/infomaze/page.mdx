# Internship at Infomaze Technologies


During Summer 2024, I contributed two core projects at Infomaze Technologies—a cost-reduction NLP pipeline for a printing client and a scalable backend API for a service-catalog web app—deepening my skills in NLP, linear programming, and full-stack development.

---

## NLP Pipeline to Reduce Service Costs

- **Problem framing & extraction**: Used **spaCy** to parse print-job descriptions (media type, color, volume) and extract cost-driving variables.
- **Optimization modeling**: Formulated a linear programming problem in **PuLP** to minimize total service costs and identify efficiency gains.
- **Automation & results**: Integrated extraction and solver into a single pipeline, delivering actionable, data-driven cost-saving recommendations.

---

## Backend for Web App

- **API design**: Architected RESTful endpoints with **Express.js** for service reservation, supporting full CRUD operations.
- **Data management**: Modeled and stored user and service data in **MongoDB**, ensuring flexible schema evolution.
- **Performance & security**: Implemented express-rate-limit to throttle requests and safeguard against abuse, and structured code for high availability and future scaling.
