# Internship at ASU Automation Projects

In October 2022 at Arizona State University’s Devils Invent hackathon, my team and I tackled the challenges of the outdated, manual attendance-taking system. We built a working prototype of an automated attendance management system that:

- Uses the **Canvas API** to fetch and record attendance data.
- Integrates **custom PCB boards** for in‑class scanning and data capture.
- Leverages a **Next.js** frontend for real-time attendance dashboards.
- Implements a **Spring Boot** backend for secure data processing and storage.

Our prototype impressed the judges so much they encouraged us to continue development, secured funding, and fully integrated the system with the university’s existing infrastructure. The production version now serves over 100,000 students in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence.

## My Contributions

- **React interfaces**: Designed and implemented dynamic, responsive frontend components in React to visualize attendance metrics and control device settings.
- **Automated API testing**: Created and maintained Postman scripts for over 20 REST API endpoints, uncovering and resolving edge-case errors to ensure system reliability.
