# Crisis Companion

Built during HackHarvard 2024, Crisis Companion is a disaster relief cross-platform application that assists users in locating emergency services and resources during natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, and other crises. The app is built using a combination of Flask-based APIs for backend services and a React Native front end, enabling real-time updates on shelters, health stations, financial aid centers, and disaster zones.
